# F.L.A.M.E.S
I was bored ! So I made a website to play the FLAMES game straight from 8th standard.
This is a simple Flask application with a basic structure that serves an HTML page styled with CSS.  

## Requirements  

- Python 3.x  
- Flask  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git  
   cd your-repo-name  
   ```  

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```  

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install flask  
   ```  

## Usage  

1. Run the Flask application:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  

2. Open your browser and visit:  
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000  
   ```
